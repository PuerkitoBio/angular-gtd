# AngularJS GTD

This is an experiment / example app using [AngularJS][ajs] to build a simple tags-based Getting Things Done web app, because it's a (tiny) *little bit* more fun and complex than a todo app.

It started with the [angular-seed project from GitHub][seed], and at the moment, uses no persistence mechanism, so everything is lost once the browser closes or the user navigates to another page.
